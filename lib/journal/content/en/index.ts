      Slow mornings are not an indulgence.
      They are a return to proportion.

      The way light enters a space,
      the way stone holds temperature,
      the way air moves through open structure —
      these are not decorative choices.
      They are architectural decisions.

      On an island without motorised noise,
      morning has texture.

      Stone is not nostalgic.
      It is structural memory.

      Mediterranean architecture is not about style.
      It is about light management.

      When light is strong,
      materials must respond quietly.

        content: `
      The absence of engines changes perception.

      Without motorised traffic,
      distances feel different.
      Conversations travel further.
      Silence gains weight.

      Architecture is not isolated from this condition.
      It becomes softer,
      more permeable,
      more attuned to human scale.
